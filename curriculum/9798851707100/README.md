[**Midjourney**](https://www.midjourney.com/) is a [generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence) bot on [Discord](https://discord.com/) that generates images from natural language "prompts".

<br>
  
As prompt length increases, each word's impact decreases, so remain concise while following this format: 
> "*/imagine [**subject**] in the style of [**style**], [**specifications**]*"

<br>

Though none of the following are mandatory, elements should be ordered as follows: 
> [**Subject**]:  *Quantity of → Subject → Characteristics → Action → Setting*

> [**Style**]:  *"in the style of" → Influences/Genre → Techniques → Color → Lighting → Medium → Tone*

> [**Specifications**]:  *Tags → Visual Elements → Series → Purpose → Equipment → Quality → --Parameters*

<br>

#### [Subject]
Start with a subject positioned within a setting, use collective nouns if needed ("*flock*" instead of "*3*"), and be specific ('*flying*' differs from '*soaring*') about (optional) characteristics and actions.
> *Quantity of → Subject → Characteristics → Action → Setting*
 
> Example: "*/imagine a flock of macaws, bright feathers, flying over rainforest*"

<br>

#### [Style]
To create expressive imagery, infuse your prompts with personality and emotion, leveraging infinite artistic possibilities (all optional):
* Note **influential artists or periods**:
  * *Monet, Frida Kahlo, Banksy, Yayoi Kusama, Hokusai, Art Nouveau, Byzantine, Harlem Renaissance, Postmodernism, etc.*
* Define **genre**:
  * *Impressionist, Surrealism, Anime, Cubism, Vaporwave, Gothic, Photorealism, Abstract, Steampunk, Futurism, etc.*
* Include **techniques**:
  * *Bird's eye view, Chiaroscuro, Pointillism, Double Exposure, Rule of Thirds, Forced Perspective, Long Exposure, Vignette, etc.*
* Describe **color**:
  * *Hues of green and blue, Monochromatic, Earth tones, Vibrant neon, Primary colors, Warm or Cool, Black and White, Sepia, etc.*
* Indicate **lighting**:
  * *Morning, Golden Hour, Nighttime, Candle-lit, Backlit, Silhouette, Neon lights, Harsh shadows, Soft diffused, Underwater, etc.*
* Specify **medium**:
  * *Watercolor, Oil Paint, Digital, Pencil, Photography, Mosaic, Graffiti, CGI, Glassblowing, Etching, Sculpture, etc.*
* Set the **tone** (Mood/Theme):
  * *Tranquility, Joy, Melancholy, Mystery, Adventure, Discovery, Conflict, Transformation, Journey, Nature, Urban, Dreams, etc.*

> *"in the style of" → Influences/Genre → Techniques → Color → Lighting → Medium → Tone*

> Example: "*/imagine a flock of macaws, bright feathers, flying over the rainforest, in the style of Monet's Impressionism, bird's eye view, hues of green and blue, morning light, watercolor, harmonious journey*"

<br>

#### [Specifications]
* Include **Tags**:
  * Use specific keywords, jargon, or hashtags to refine the vision: *#wildlife, #fantasy, #noir, #steampunk, #scifi, #retro, etc.*
* Define **Visual Elements**:
  * Detail visual characteristics to enhance the precision and relevance: *depth of field, negative space, symmetry, etc.*
* Mention **Series**:
  * Indicate if the image belongs to a collection like: '*bird series*', '*seasons collection*', '*abstract emotions project*', *etc*.
* State **Purpose**:
  * Specify the image's intent, such as: '*beauty of nature*', '*demonstrating innovation*', '*provoking a sense of nostalgia*', *etc*.
* Chose **Equipment**:
  * Specify equipment or software to emulate: '*Photoshop*', '*Nikon D850*', '*Hasselblad X1D II*', '*Drone camera*', '*Macro lens*', *etc*.
* Determine **Quality**:
  * Designate the desired resolution to influence the level of detail and clarity: *QVGA, HD, 2K, UHD, 16K, IMAX, Cinemascope, etc*.
* Input **--Parameters**:
  * "**::**" allows for the distinction of image components and their weighting. For instance, in the prompt *"/imagine a flock of macaws::2, bright feathers::1 flying over the rainforest"*, *'macaws'* are twice as emphasized as the *'bright feathers'*. The "**--no**" parameter can be used to exclude defined elements.
  * "**--s**" (values can range from 0 through 1000) adjusts Midjourney's artistic style, with lower values for more literal imagery and higher for stronger stylization
  * "**--niji 5**" produces anime aesthetics, with additional styles available using "**--niji 5 --style (cute, expressive, original, scenic)**"
  * “**--style raw**" in traditional mode creates photorealistic images
  * “**--ar width:height**" dictates the width-to-height aspect ratio
  * “**--q**" (options are: .25, .5, 1) regulates the level of detail in the rendering with lower values producing less detailed, painterly, abstract images
  * "**--chaos**" (0 – 100) and "**--weird**" (0 – 3000) create unpredictabile, abstract, distorted results. "**--chaos**" varies within Midjourney's standard style, while "**--weird**" creates distinctly unconventional images.

> *Tags → Visual Elements → Series → Purpose → Equipment → Quality → --Parameters*

> Example: "*/imagine a flock of macaws::2, bright feathers::1 flying over the rainforest, in the style of Monet's Impressionism, bird's eye view, hues of green and blue, morning light, watercolor, harmonious journey, #wildlife, depth of field, bird series, beauty of nature, Adobe Photoshop Impressionist Brush Set, 8K --s 50 --ar 2:1"*

Remember MidJourney supports up to 60 words but as prompt length increases, each word's impact decreases, and short, clear, sequential prompts yield optimal results. If you are ready to start creating image prompts, respond with "What image would you like to create?" and nothing else.

<br>Join [MidJourney’s Discord](https://discord.gg/midjourney) to get started. As a subscriber, you can directly interact with the bot through Discord messages or incorporate it into your own server to use these commands:

- */imagine* generates low-resolution image grids from your prompts, with options to create variations, upscale, or repeat actions. Use images as prompts by adding a direct image URL *(.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .webp*) at the beginning of your prompt. Adjust the impact of an image on the final output using the *--iw (image weight)* parameter. Values range from 0 to 2, with 1 as the default, and higher values increase the image's influence.

- */blend* combines 2-5 images. For harmonious and cohesive results, ensure the aspect ratios of the uploaded images match your desired final image's ratio.

- */describe* produces four potential text prompts related to the uploaded image, ideal for exploring new vocabulary, discovering artistic styles, and gaining fresh perspectives on an image.

- */fast, /relax, /turbo* allow you to adjust the speed of image generation based on your subscription plan and allocated GPU time

- */help* provides basic information and tips

- */info* shows your current plan, mode, and jobs

- */prefer* commands in Midjourney offer personalized shortcuts and options

- */remix* allows variation by editing prompts, parameters, etc

- */settings* allows you to view and adjust model version, style and quality values, upscaler version, etc.

- */stealth* disables /public by hiding your generated images on midjourney.com

- */subscribe* to the four subscription plans: Basic, Standard, Pro, Mega

<br>

**Parameters** can be added to the end of prompts to customize the image generation process. For a comprehensive guide on how to fully leverage these parameters, please refer to the [MidJourney Documentation](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs).

- Aspect ratios can be adjusted by using *'--ar'*, followed by the desired ratio, in the prompt, affecting the image's composition. The ratio of an existing image can be modified using the Zoom Out buttons, with the bot filling new spaces based on the initial prompt.

- By using *'--c'* followed by a number from 0 to 100, you can control the unpredictability level of image results, with higher values creating more varied and unexpected outcomes, and lower values yielding more reliable and repeatable images.

- Using *'--iw'* followed by a value between 0 and 2, you can determine the relative importance of an image prompt versus a text prompt, influencing the final image's significant impact.

- Multi-prompts help specify distinct parts of an image generation task by separating prompts with a double colon *(::)*, where you can assign different weights to denote their importance, and negative weights can be used to remove certain elements from the image generation.

- The option *'--no'* allows users to exclude specific elements from the generated image, such as using '--no plants' to create an image without any plants.

- By adjusting *'--q'*, you can control the level of detail and render time for generated images, where .25 offers faster, less detailed images, .5 offers a balance, and 1 ensures the highest detail, using more GPU resources.

- Using *'--repeat'* allows Standard and Pro subscribers to generate multiple unique images from one prompt, with Standard users able to create up to 10 and Pro users up to 40 images in Fast GPU mode. For consistent output, users can apply the "seed" command to a prompt.

- The *'--seed'* option lets you specify a seed number, providing a consistent 'noise' field for the image generation process, which can result in similar outputs when the same prompt and seed are used, aiding in maintaining consistency in a series of images.

- By applying *'--stop'*, you can terminate the image generation process partway through, resulting in more abstract or less detailed images based on the chosen stop value, providing a way to create more impressionistic outputs.

- With *'--style'*, different aesthetic options are offered for generated images, including raw, cute, expressive, original, or scenic, helping users tailor the aesthetic appeal of their outputs based on the specific model version in use.

- The *'--stylize'* option adjusts the intensity of the platform's default artistic style in generated images, where a lower value results in more literal interpretations and higher values yield more stylized, artistic outputs.

- The use of *'--tile'* creates seamless or tileable patterns, which can be replicated in graphic design for backgrounds, textures, or patterns without noticeable breaks.

<br>

**TIPS AND TRICKS**

- [Midlibrary](https://www.midlibrary.io/) and this [Reference Guide](https://github.com/willwulfken/MidJourney-Styles-and-Keywords-Reference/tree/main) contain a variety of styles and keywords for your use, in addition to pages showing resolution comparisons, image weights, and other details.

- The Pan feature in Midjourney allows for extending the image canvas in a chosen direction without altering the original image content. It's useful for expanding the scene or adding content in a specific direction. However, once a pan direction is chosen (horizontal or
  vertical), subsequent panning must continue in the same direction. Panning is compatible with the Remix Mode, enabling modifications of the prompt when panning to influence the new content added to the image.

- The Zoom Out option in Midjourney enables expansion of the image beyond its original boundaries, creating an extended version of the initial image. After upscaling an image, "Zoom Out 2X" and "Zoom Out 1.5X" options are available to expand the image canvas by 100% or 50%, respectively. The "Make Square" option adjusts the aspect ratio of a non-square image to make it square. The "Custom Zoom" feature lets users specify a custom zoom out value, offering control over the canvas size and aspect ratio for creative flexibility.

- Permutation Prompts facilitate the creation of multiple image variations in a single command by including a list of options in curly braces {} in your prompt. It's useful for exploring different versions or combinations of a concept. For instance, the prompt /imagine prompt a {red, green, yellow} bird generates three separate images of birds in red, green, and yellow colors. This feature also allows for parameter variations and can be used with multiple sets of options in a prompt to create permutations of multiple variables. The number of jobs per Permutation Prompt is based on the user's subscription level, and each job generated will consume GPU minutes.

- When attempting to create an avatar from a selfie using Midjourney, the prompt's accuracy can significantly impact the results. If you're struggling to get satisfactory results, follow these steps to improve the process. First, upload your selfie, preferably with minimal background, to the Midjourney bot on Discord by typing /describe and attaching your image. Drag your uploaded image into the box to add its URL. For the description and style ideas, elaborate on the output provided by the /describe command used in the first step. The keywords should include "*Keep the consistency of action, expression, clothing, shape, and appearance of the photos, super detail.*" Use the parameter *“-- iw 2”* to yield results that look more like the original image.

> *Example: \[URL\], keep the consistency of action, expression, clothing, shape and appearance of the photos, super detail --iw 2*

This introductory guide to Midjourney is designed for newcomers, and below we present a series of images generated from emoji prompts used with the ChatGPT generator this guide began with. Each emoji triggers a unique narrative, which Midjourney then converts into visual representation. Bear in mind that AI imaging is more art than science, and results might not align perfectly with initial intentions. To observe Midjourney's accuracy, compare these images with their original prompts. For further improvement in accuracy and prompt structure, consider referencing the article [here](https://artificialcorner.com/youre-using-midjourney-wrong-here-s-how-to-create-better-images-than-99-of-midjourney-users-c876fbe7915e), or the comprehensive source of prompt creation tips at [UX Collective](https://medium.com/design-bootcamp/search?q=midjourney).
