Below we present a basic structure for a conventional graduation pathway that can be enriched by including a 'Scope and Study' for each module, thus creating a well-rounded course plan. This is proposed as a way to rejuvenate the commonplace high school syllabus that students typically find uninteresting. It's crucial to pivot towards captivating subjects such as video game design (like Fortnite), construction, engineering, among others. Our objective is to offer curriculum that is not only relevant but also engaging for students in this way.
