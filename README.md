[Joone](https://joone.org) develops free, open-source K-12 [curricula](https://github.com/joone-org/curriculum.joone.org/wiki) that seamlessly combines [core academics](https://github.com/joone-org/curriculum.joone.org/wiki/California-Graduation-Requirements) with [career and technical education paths](https://github.com/joone-org/curriculum.joone.org/wiki/Career-Technical-Education-(CTE)-Pathways). With an emphasis on college and career readiness, our approach is diverse, inclusive, and equitable. All content is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/joone-org/intro-to-github), written in [markdown](https://github.com/joone-org/intro-to-markdown), and designed for integration with your [Learning Management System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system). You're welcome to review the initial iterations of our work below. Please contribute your insights to their ongoing development in the [wiki](https://github.com/joone-org/curriculum.joone.org/wiki).
