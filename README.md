We develop free, open-source K-12 curricula that seamlessly combines [core academics](https://github.com/joone-org/curriculum.joone.org/wiki/California-Graduation-Requirements) with [career and technical education paths](https://github.com/joone-org/curriculum.joone.org/wiki/Career-Technical-Education-(CTE)-Pathways). With an emphasis on college and career readiness, our approach is diverse, inclusive, and equitable. All content, contributed by a [global community](https://github.com/joone-org/curriculum.joone.org/wiki), is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/joone-org/intro-to-github), written in [markdown](https://github.com/joone-org/intro-to-markdown), and designed for integration with your [Learning Management System (LMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system).
